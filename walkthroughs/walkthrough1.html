        <h2>Adventure walkthrough</h2>

        <p>
            This is not claimed to be an optimized walkthrough, but it comes reasonably
            close and, if you don't get killed by a little dwarf and if the pirate shows
            up before you finish, you can get all the points.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you get well into the cave you will encounter some nasty dwarves.  The
            first one simply tosses an axe at you and runs away.  The axe misses.  Get the
            axe; you'll need it when you see the dwarves again.  On your second encounter
            with the dwarves, you'll see one or more, who will throw knives at you.  The
            first salvo always misses.  Toss the axe at a dwarf, fetch it again, and keep
            tossing until you have killed all the dwarves present.  You'll need to do this
            each time a dwarf appears.  If you don't, you'll get killed.  (Be sure to
            retrieve the axe after you have killed the last dwarf that is with you.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't worry if a pirate appears and steals your treasures from you.  You'll
            find them again later on.

            If the pirate never appears, you probably won't make it.  When you reach the
            dead end where the chest is supposed to be, you could backtrack (if you know
            how) through the maze and then forward again until he appears.  If this takes
            too many turns your lamp batteries will wear out before the end game, and then
            it's tough beans.
